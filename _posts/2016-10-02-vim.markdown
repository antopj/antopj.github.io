`Vim` is one of the handy and most common text editor in Linux. It is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for editing programs.

There  are  a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..  See `:help vi_diff.txt` for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

It is the all-in-one editor we would be using for editing configuration files, editing any files on Linux/Coming tutorial posts.
